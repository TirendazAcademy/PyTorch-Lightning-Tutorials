[PyTorch-Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html) is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper that helps you scale your deep learning code in a structured and efficient way. With Lightning, you can easily organize your code into reusable and modular components, making it more readable, maintainable, and extendable.

PyTorch Lightning provides many useful features such as automatic checkpointing, distributed training, and mixed precision training out of the box, freeing you to focus on your research or product development. Lightning also integrates seamlessly with PyTorch, so you can leverage all the powerful PyTorch functionalities while getting the benefits of a high-level framework.

In this repo, we walk you through how to perform deep learning projects with PyTorch-Lightning step-by-step.
